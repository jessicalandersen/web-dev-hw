13. I looked up some fonts on the google fonts website. I chose the font that I did because I felt as if it fit nicely with the theme of the book since it was fairly simple and elegant.
14. A system font is a font specific to the system it is being displayed on such as a windows computer or a mac computer. A web font is a font that is used on a webpage and is coded using CSS. A web safe font is a font that will look similar on any given system the website is bein displayed on A fallback font is a font that is used when the font that is selected cannot run on the system the webpage is being viewed in.
15. For this assignment I began as I always do by reading through the website materials very carefully to get a better understanding of the material for the week. Then I begin by coding the basic elements I am most comfortable with first such as meta elements. Then when I run into problems, I use the internet as a resource to help me through.
