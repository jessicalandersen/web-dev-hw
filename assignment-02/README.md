I decided to take this class to learn how to make a website. As a marketing major, I feel as if this is a very good skill to have. It is also very important to have a website to showcase my marketing portfolio.
I hope to learn more about designing a website, I like that we have started learning the basics of coding. I also am excited to make my own website.
