 Whiskey with the team, got it bubblin'
 I got trees in my luggage
 I got teams out in London
 Hope you came, what you say?
 Fuck is you sayin'?
 Oh when I say I been at the Ace hotel
 You gotta tell me something
 Fuck is you sayin'?
 Oh let me tell you, I been on the way
 What you sayin'?
 I'm making runs
 I'm roll on track, I'm in this field
 I'm shocked, you put me in my feels
 She made it clap clap clap clappity-clap out in Clapton
 Swerve and I crash if the pillow ain't your passion
 She think I'm a liar like the Obamacare
 If the old never heard the soul country so slick
 Butterskin smooth Acne shoes, contradict
 You can hop right offa my country
 Team, got it bubblin'
 I got trees in my luggage
 I got teams out in London
 Hope you came, what you say?
 Fuck is you sayin'?
 Oh when I say I been at the Ace hotel
 You gotta tell me something
 Fuck is you sayin'?
 Oh let me tell you, I been on the way
 What you sayin'?
 I'm making runs
 Smino Grigio, Noname, and Saba the best rappers
 And radio niggas sound like they wearing adult diapers
 And globalization scary and fuckin is fantastic
 And frankly I find it funny that Morgan is still acting
 Bruce Almighty, Aphrodite and Dominoes
 Yummy biscotti, tamale, over mention my undertones
 Runnin' the dolly, Chicago overzealous with talent though
 Westside get the money, is still a classic
 Movin' to LA, now I'm sippin on Sunny D
 And my nigga is hella pleased and I bought me a better pencil
 Bitch she ain't about to write, I'm perpetually smoking weed
 Yes me rolling, I'm sorry, I'm tapping out
 Room 25, the best album that's coming out
 Labels got these niggas just doing it for the clout
 I'm just writing my darkest secrets like wait and just hear me out
 Saying vegan food is delicious like wait and just hear me out
 I ain't been at home in a minute, my landlord been getting pissed
 'Cause I barely count as a tenant, I'm overseas with the yen and shit
 And I can't recall the last time that my live show was intimate
 The price for the show just went up in addition to tickets that
 They didn't figure it out in 2012 so I just said fuck it
 'Cause we can drop all our albums ourselves yeah I just said fuck it
 'Cause I know I got the gifts like an elf and been wrapping raps around them like I'm a belt
 That's tea not ginger beer, I whisper in they ear
 Since I left the road, I got more hits than a deer
 A dollar and a dream like I'm Jermaine in the Ville
 You stand up or fall, pray, shout out to NFL
 Pure bred delicatessen
 Damn, I'm real, I can tell it
 I do not fall to no pressure
 Cookin' up Barefoot Contessa
 I just raise the bar
 I look at it with a measure
 With little to no effort
 I thought it gonna be messed up
 Bless up
 Whiskey with the team, got it bubblin'
 I got trees in my luggage
 I got teams out in London
 Hope you came, what you say?
 Fuck is you sayin'?
 Oh when I say I been at the Ace hotel
 You gotta tell me something
 Fuck is you sayin'?
 Oh let me tell you, I been on the way
 What you sayin'?
 I'm making runs, ooh
