13. I was completely new to web development before I took this class. I had absolutely no experience with coding or what it takes to successfully code a website. I knew it was hard, but I didn't quite know how hard. While I don't think I'll be designing websites anytime soon, I learned so much in this class about web development and using GitHub and Atom.
14. As I mentioned above, I had o experience in coding before I took this class. I did not know a single thing about HTML or CSS. I feel very confident in HTML now and I feel like I have a very good understanding of the language. I do not feel the same about CSS. CSS is much trickier and I do not feel nearly as confident with it, but I'm glad I at least gave it a shot and did my best to learn and understand the language.
15. For this assignment, I started by looking back at old assignments and taking inspiration from there. I used the same format of a stylesheet that I did for last weeks assignment and I just changed it so it better fit what this project was. I also used the book to refresh my memory on elements that I was unsure of. I then found a topic and filled in the different pages to make a complete site.
