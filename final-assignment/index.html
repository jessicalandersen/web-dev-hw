            <h2>My Current Favorites<h2>
            <h3>Currently, my go to palettes have been the Huda Beauty "New Nude Palette" and the Tarte "Tartelette in Bloom". These are both great palettes for spring and offer a beautiful selection of colors that are great for a variety of different needs.
            For foundation, I have been loving the Nars Sheer Glow and the Hourglass Vanish liquid foundation. Bot of these offer great coverage, but never look cakey or dry.
            A new product I have beent trying out is the new Too Faced Born This Way concealer. This had a pretty lackluster launch and mosst people glossed over the concealer entirely. I loved this concealer and I find it very similar to the cult favorite Tarte Shape Tape. The Born this Way has more product for the same price as well, so it's a better bang for your buck.
